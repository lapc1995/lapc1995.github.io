Digital Jewellery is created by individual practitioners who combine art, craft and design skills with electronics. Understandings of these practices are fragmented as the different commentators and creators draw upon different traditions from a diversity of artistic, fashion, engineering and participatory design approaches. It is difficult to develop a synthesis of different perspectives as their abilities, inspiration, motivations, methods, materials and techniques are idiosyncratic. To address this, I engaged six leading digital jewellers in a structured and iterative dialogue to establish a collective understanding of their approaches and attitudes.
